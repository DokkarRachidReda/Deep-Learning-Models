# Deep-Learning-Models
 collection of my deep learning  models
## Resources :
* [tutorialspoint] (https://www.tutorialspoint.com/) to learn Numpy Pandas ...
* [Intro to Deep Learning with PyTorch](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud188) Udacity course to learn about deep learning
* [Kaggle] (https://www.kaggle.com) to find datasets and challengs
* [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) to train models in gpu for free :)
## Content :

* Model to recognize digits (0..9) from 28x28x1 images (MNIST dataset), the challenge from Kaggle [digit-recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer)
  
  you can find this model in ``` ./Digits.ipynb ```



## Contribution :
feel free to contribute or to report any error or improvment to any model, i would be happy to add your model here too :)
